\begin{slide}{Summary}
\begin{itemize}
  \setlength\itemsep{1em}
  \item We have implemented an efficient incremental algorithm over regular datatypes
  \item The incremental algorithm is faster than the non-incremental version when the data structure contains more than $10^3$ nodes
  \item We introduced the pattern synonyms to improve the developer experience to almost the same
  level as the non-incremental implementation
  \item However, the initial pass of the incremental algorithm is a lot slower than the non-incremental version. Therefore, the incremental algorithm needs to be performed a lot (with small changes), before being overall faster than the non-incremental version.
\end{itemize}
